# This workflow demonstrates the CI/CD pipeline from Chapter 10
# It runs automatically on push to main and on pull requests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up a Java development environment
      - name: Set up JDK 21
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '21'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: 'maven'

      # Step 3: Build the application
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn -B clean compile --file pom.xml

      # Step 4: Run automated tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: mvn test

      # Step 5: Package the application (creates a JAR file)
      - name: Package application
        run: mvn package -DskipTests

      # Step 6: Store the package as an artifact for deployment
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
