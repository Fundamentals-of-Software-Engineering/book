## Instructions

1. **Fill out your current radar** based on:
   - Technologies you use daily at work
   - Technologies in job postings that interest you
   - Emerging tech from blogs and conferences

2. **Review quarterly** and ask:
   - Does this still align with my career goals?
   - Should anything move to a different ring?
   - Are there new technologies to add?

3. **Be strategic**:
   - Focus on technologies that align with your career roadmap
   - Don't chase every trend
   - Balance popular tech with what excites you

## Notes

- This is YOUR radar - it should reflect your goals, not industry hype
- Technologies can move between rings as priorities change
- Use this with your career roadmap to stay focused
- It's okay to say "no" by putting things in Hold
